### Description

I got thinking... What good is collision detection tutorials/demos if theres no tutorials/demos on bounding volumes? Thats the heart of 90% of the collision detection algorithms. This will show how to compute bounding box's and bounding spheres for an object. It also shows how to compute the distance from the center-center of the object and the edge-edge distance (Collision Distance). I made it in hopes this will help someone understand collision detection better. If it helps you or you like it please vote and please, please leave some feedback. Thanks everyone.
